    <h1>Tag</h1>
    <p>An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
        structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
        content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
        element enclosed within the tags.</p>

        <h3>Tag example are given below:</h3>
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
        <br>
        <br>

        In this example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag. The content "This is a paragraph tag." is the
text within the paragraph element.

<h1>Element:</h1>
<p>An HTML element is a complete unit that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a
    distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed
    between those tags.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Example of an element</h3>
    &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph tag.&lt;/p&gt;

    <p>In this example, &lt;p&gt; is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph element." is the content, and &lt;/p&gt; is the closing tag.
    Together, they form the complete &lt;p&gt; element, representing a paragraph of text.</p>
